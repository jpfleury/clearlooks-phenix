## Overview

The Clearlooks-Phénix project aims at creating a GTK3 port of Clearlooks, the default theme for Gnome 2. Style is also included for GTK2, Unity and for Metacity, Openbox and Xfwm4 window managers.

Here are screenshots (if applicable, click to see the original image):

## Requirements

- Requirements for Clearlooks-Phénix v3 and newer: package `gtk2-engines` (if GTK2 applications are used).

## Installation

	To find your GTK version:
	
	- You should be able to find out on the command line via `gtk-launch --version`.
	
	- If you use Ubuntu, here's a correspondence between its versions and those of GTK (for a default installation of Ubuntu):
	
		- Ubuntu 11.10: GTK 3.2
		- Ubuntu 12.04: GTK 3.4
		- Ubuntu 12.10 and 13.04: GTK 3.6
		- Ubuntu 13.10: GTK 3.8
		- Ubuntu 14.04: GTK 3.10
		- Ubuntu 14.10: GTK 3.12
		- Ubuntu 15.04: GTK 3.14
		- Ubuntu 15.10: GTK 3.16
		- Ubuntu 16.04: GTK 3.18
		- Ubuntu 16.10: GTK 3.20

	- For other distributions, you can check out the tables available at [DistroWatch.com](https://distrowatch.com/).

- Extract the archive.

- Rename the extracted folder to `Clearlooks-Phenix`.

- Copy the folder `Clearlooks-Phenix` in one of the following locations:

	For the current user:
	- [$XDG\_DATA\_HOME](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)`/themes`, or
	- `~/.themes/` (for GTK+ 2);

	For all users, including style for programs ran with root privileges (e.g.
	your package-update utility):
	- `/usr/share/themes/`

### Selection

The theme must be selected once the installation is complete:

- On Gnome: with [gnome-tweak-tool](https://live.gnome.org/GnomeTweakTool), by setting *Theme > Window theme* and *Theme > GTK+ theme*, or in a terminal:

		dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/wm/preferences/theme \'Clearlooks-Phenix\'
		dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/interface/gtk-theme \'Clearlooks-Phenix\'

- On Xfce: by going to *Settings > Appearence > Style* in the main menu for the GTK theme, and to *Settings > Window Manager > Style* for the Xfwm4 theme, or in a terminal:

		xfconf-query -s Clearlooks-Phenix -c xfwm4 -p /general/theme
		xfconf-query -s Clearlooks-Phenix -c xsettings -p /Net/ThemeName

- Otherwise, set `gtk-theme-name` in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/settings.ini` (GTK+ 3) or `~/.gtkrc-2.0` (GTK+ 2).

## Configuration

### Desktop managed by Nautilus

By default, the font color on a desktop managed by Nautilus is black. To set it to white, open the file `gtk-3.0/applications.css` with a text editor, find the code relative to Nautilus:

	/************
	 * Nautilus *
	 ************/
	
	/*
	COMMENTED
	CSS
	CODE
	*/

and uncomment it, as follows:

	/************
	 * Nautilus *
	 ************/
	
	UNCOMMENTED
	CSS
	CODE

To get a custom color, change the color directly in the file `gtk-3.0/applications.css`.

### Window buttons layout

If after installing or updating GNOME, the window buttons are on the left side, but you want them to the right, run the following command in a terminal:

	gconftool-2 --set /apps/metacity/general/button_layout --type string ":minimize,maximize,close"

### Wallpaper

The wallpaper used for the Gnome 3 desktop screenshot is available in the folder `wallpapers`.

### Icons

The icon theme used for the same screenshot is Mist, installed with the package `gnome-themes`, under LGPL. Here's an easy way to install Mist:

- [Download the archive of the Mist icon theme.](http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/os/i386/Packages/gnome-themes-2.28.1-6.el6.noarch.rpm)

- Extract the archive.

- Copy the folder `usr/share/icons/Mist` in one of the following locations:

	For the current user:
	- `$XDG_DATA_HOME/icons/`
	- `~/.icons/` (for GTK+ 2);
	
	For all users:
	- `/usr/share/icons/`

- Then, choose Mist:

	- on Gnome: with gnome-tweak-tool by setting *Theme > Icon theme*;
	
	- on Xfce: by going to *Settings > Appearence > Icons* in the main menu;

	- otherwise, set `gtk-icon-theme-name` in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/settings.ini`
	  for GTK+ 3 or ~/.gtkrc-2.0 for GTK+ 2.
